There client base is increasing and they need to go digital to manage their work properly.
They need help in create a working software which will help them in managing :
1. List of vets working abd their schedule
2. List of pet types they are providing service for.
3. List of pets their owners.
4. Manage booking for pet's visitation based on the available schedules of the vets.
